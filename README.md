# Yan.js ~ Minimal ES6 Toolkit For 2D Games

Yan ( Derived from Sanskrit word "यान" which means "The Vehicle" ) is a Tiny 2D Game Development toolkit 
written in ES6.

It Offers:-

+ a Tiny DOM Manipulation Library 'tez'
+ Simple Math and Collision Library
+ Utility Library ( with some unique functions )
+ a "Device" module which gives you information related to the user's device

You can load and use all modules as a bundle:-

```javascript
  import * as yan from './yan.js';
  
  // your code
```

or import each module individually as per your need:-

```javascript
  import { qs, ready } from './yan/tez.js';
  import { pointInCircle } from './yan/collision.js';
  
  // your code
```

Jai Bharat!
